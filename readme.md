<h3> VisionTrack: A Computer Vision Solution for Railway Station Safety and Cleanliness </h3>
VisionTrack is a cutting-edge computer vision project aimed at improving the safety and hygiene of railway stations. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of the YOLOv8 model (YOLO version 8, large), VisionTrack offers a robust and efficient solution for monitoring and managing crowd density and cleanliness. Below are the key features and technical details of the project:
Key Features:

### 1.	Overcrowding Detection:

o	Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors railway stations to identify overcrowded areas using live video feeds.

o	Alerts and Notifications: Automatically sends email alerts with attached photos or video clips when overcrowding is detected, allowing for immediate action.

o	Threshold for Alerts: Generates an alert when more than 5 people are detected in a designated area, ensuring timely intervention to prevent hazardous overcrowding situations.

o	Safety Compliance: Helps maintain safety regulations by preventing hazardous overcrowding situations.

### 2.	Cleanliness Monitoring:

o	Dirt and Trash Detection: Uses YOLOv8 to accurately detect unclean areas, including litter and other unsanitary conditions.

o	Automated Messaging: Sends instant message alerts to maintenance teams for prompt cleaning actions when unclean areas are detected.

o	Threshold for Alerts: Generates an alert when more than 5 polybags or waste objects are detected in an area, ensuring high standards of cleanliness.

o	Enhanced Hygiene: Ensures high standards of cleanliness, improving the overall passenger experience.

### 3.	Flexible Input Options: Upload Media/ Webcam

### Technical Details:

â€¢	YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8, Large):

o	Real-Time Object Detection: Efficiently detects multiple objects in images or videos in real-time with high accuracy.

o	Advanced Accuracy: Capable of identifying overcrowded and unclean areas with improved precision and reduced false positives.

o	Fast Processing Speed: Ensures quick analysis and prompt alerts, crucial for real-time monitoring and response.

### â€¢	Alert and Notification System:

o	Email Notifications: Utilizes an email server to send automated alerts through railway organisationâ€™s email using passkey, to concerned authorises containing alert with media attachments, ensuring timely communication.

### â€¢	Scalability and Customization:

o	Scalable Infrastructure: Designed to handle multiple cameras and input sources, making it suitable for large and complex railway stations.

o	Customizable Settings: Can be tailored to meet the specific needs and requirements of different railway stations.
